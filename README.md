🚀 Harnessing the Power of Transfer Learning with Xception! 🐱🐶

In this project, we utilized transfer learning with the Xception model to classify images of cats and dogs. Here’s a quick rundown of the process:

🔹 Data Preparation: Loaded and split the cats_vs_dogs dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
🔹 Model Setup: Leveraged the pre-trained Xception model, freezing its layers to retain learned features.
🔹 Customization: Added custom layers tailored for our binary classification task.
🔹 Training: Compiled and trained the model, focusing on the custom layers.
🔹 Evaluation: Assessed the model’s performance on validation and test datasets.
