The notebook demonstrates the use of transfer learning with the Xception model to classify images from the cats_vs_dogs dataset.

Importing Libraries and Loading Data:

Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) are imported.

The cats_vs_dogs dataset is loaded and split into training, validation, and test sets.

Loading the Pre-trained Xception Model:

The Xception model pre-trained on ImageNet is loaded without the top classification layer.
The layers of the Xception model are frozen to retain the learned features.

Adding Custom Layers:


Custom layers are added on top of the base model, including a global average pooling layer, a fully connected layer, and an output layer suitable for binary classification.

Compiling the Model:

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as a metric.

Training the Model:

The model is trained on the new dataset with the custom layers being updated during training.

Evaluating the Model:

The model is evaluated on the validation and test sets to assess its performance.

Advantages of Transfer Learning: 
Reduced Training Time:

Leveraging pre-trained weights significantly reduces the training time compared to training a model from scratch.
Improved Performance:

The pre-trained Xception model provides a robust feature extraction base, improving performance on the new dataset.
Efficiency:

Depthwise separable convolutions in Xception reduce the number of parameters and computational cost.
Flexibility:

The model can be easily adapted for various tasks by fine-tuning the pre-trained weights on new datasets.
